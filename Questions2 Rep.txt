
Q1:In K-Nearest Neighbors, which of the following is true:
a/A very high value of K (ex. K = 100) produces an overly generalised model, while a very low value of k (ex. k = 1) produces a highly complex model.
b/A very high value of K (ex. K = 100) produces a model that is better than a very low value of K (ex. K = 1)
c/A very high value of k (ex. k = 100) produces a highly complex model, while a very low value of K (ex. K = 1) produces an overly generalized model.
Q2:A classifier with lower log loss has better accuracy.
a/True
b/False
Q3:When building a decision tree, we want to split the nodes in a way that decreases entropy and increases information gain.
a/true
b/false

Reponse:
1/ a)A very high value of K (ex. K = 100) produces an overly generalised model, while a very low value of k (ex. k = 1) produces a highly complex model
2/ a)True
3/ a)True
